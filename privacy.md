This website uses Google Analytics to help analyse how visitors use this site. Google Analytics uses “cookies” to collect information about visitor behaviour in an **anonymous form**. This information is transmitted to Google - not me. Then it is processed to compile statstical reports on website activity for this site only. I use these reports to evaulate aggregate visitor usage, so I can optimize the content of the site. 

In summary, **your anonymity is safe with me**. That is my personal commitment to you as a valued reader.
