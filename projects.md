#HCLang
HCLang is a new programming language with primary focus on massive parallelization and non-blocking concurrency.

However, the design of the language pursues more aspects:

 - scalability: 
    - **non-blocking parallelization and concurrency**
    - **distributed computing** features (final stage)
 - sanity of programmer: 
    - **easy to learn**
    - **clean and expressive code**
    - **safe and secure**
 - resource friendly: 
    - **versatile type system** to tune high-performance applications
    - **non-GarbageCollected** - well, that RAM consumption

*Motivation: I believe that parallelization is the future. Essentially all common CPUs, except low-power ones, are superscalar(instruction-level parallelism).*

***Warning:** the language is still in early stage of development, so it implements very limited set of mentioned features*
