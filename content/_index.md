Software Developer born and living in Slovakia.

I develop [ArchiveKeep](https://archivekeep.org) in my free time. It's an open-source personal files archivation tool, that's scratching my own itch, and I believe it would be useful for others as well.

Please consider buying me a pizza, if you like what I do and you want to support it.

<div class="ideals">

## My ideals

> Digital technologies enrich people's lifes, with no (hidden) exploitation.
>
> True ownership of things is a right of users, including the full control. 
> 
> Lasting value is provided by physical products, with no planned obsolescence. The functionality can be studied, and altered by product's owners based on owner's needs. Or, by a person of their choice they delegate or hire to do so.
>
> Real free market with freedom for anyone to participate, invent, create and extend existing solutions, with no arbitrary restrictions.
>
> No privacy violations, that could be misused as ultimate power to massively abuse, oppress, exploit or take unfair advantage of others.
