## My ideals

> Digital technologies enrich people's lifes, with no (hidden) exploitation.
>
> True ownership of things is a right of users, including the full control. 
> 
> Lasting value is provided by physical products, with no planned obsolescence. The functionality can be studied, and altered by product's owners based on owner's needs. Or, by a person of their choice they delegate or hire to do so.
>
> Real free market with freedom for anyone to participate, invent, create and extend existing solutions, with no arbitrary restrictions.
>
> No privacy violations, that could be misused as ultimate power to massively abuse, oppress, exploit or take unfair advantage of others.
