  > As a product grows both in features and data, customers will eventually need more advanced tools to help them analyse and derive actionable insights. Regardless of the product, this will most likely take the form of filters as the prominent tool for in-app analytics.

  > This was the case with Qonto just a few months ago. From the beginning, we enabled our customers to filter and search for their transactions. We started off with simple, mono-dimensional filters that served our customers well.
